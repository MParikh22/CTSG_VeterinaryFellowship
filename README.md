2024 Veterinary Aquaculture Research and Policy Fellowship application materials 

Connecticut Sea Grant Veterinary Aquaculture Research & Policy Fellowship at NOAA Fisheries, Milford, CT

This 2â€“4 week program is designed for veterinary students wanting to explore aquaculture
medicine research and policy. This opportunity will largely focus on bivalve shellfish aquaculture
on the east coast US. Fellows will assist the staff at the NOAA Fisheries, Milford Laboratory with
laboratory and field-based bivalve disease research based on current needs. During the
fellowship, students will become familiar with shellfish aquaculture practice, the economic,
societal, and environmental benefits it provides, and threats to shellfish health and production.
Current Milford Lab research focuses on the field epidemiology of bivalve diseases and
relationships with climate change-related environmental conditions. Fellows should expect to
gain an understanding of how veterinarians and researchers can support aquaculture
sustainability in this context. As a part of the program, fellows will also participate in career
development activities tailored to their present needs, and they will engage in networking
opportunities with other aquatic veterinarians and scientists across NOAA and Connecticut Sea
Grant. Fellows are expected to report 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday, excluding
federal holidays. Fellows will receive a stipend of $800 for each week of their fellowship.
